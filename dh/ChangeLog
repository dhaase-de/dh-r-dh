      probability distributions

    * fixed bug in function 'readImage' which caused pixmap and tiff images
      not to be loaded correctly (wrong use of 'capture.output')
    * fixed bug in error message of conversion to gray scale images in function
      'readImage'
    * updated functions 'readImage' and 'writeImage' to trigger an error if

    * added function 'file.extension<-' to replace the file extension of
      filenames
    * added function 'dirname<-' to replace the directory of filenames

    * added wrapper function 'progressBar'
    * added functions 'rot', 'rot2angle', 'deg2rad', 'rad2deg' for 2D rotations
    * fixed usage of 'rasterImage' in the function 'pm', now checks if this
      function exists and thus also works with R versions < 2.11.0
    * added support for color palettes when using the raster drawing option in
      the function 'pm'
    * fixed the range calculation and scaling when using the raster drawing
      option in the function 'pm' to also work with non-finite values
    * added predefined color palettes (function 'palettes' and object 'pal')
    * added example matrix (object 'M', value "matrix(seq(16), 4)")
    * added function 'is.loadedPackage' to check whether a package is currently
      loaded
    * added function 'equal' to check if two values are (numerically) equal

    * added function 'file.extension' which returns the extensions of filenames
    * added file 'image.R' for image-related functions
    * added functions 'readImage' and 'writeImage' as wrappers for image reading
      and writing packages (supports JPEG, PNM, PNM, TIFF)
    * added packages 'jpeg', 'png', 'pixmap' and 'rtiff' to package suggests
    * added function 'bytes.toHumanReadable' to transform a number of bytes into
      a human readable string
    * replaced function 'lso' with function 'objects.sizes' to output the size
      of R objects
    * added function 'wait' which waits for the user to hit [RETURN]
    * added file 'zzz.R' and startup message
    * added package 'utils' in the dependecies (needed to obtain package
      information using function 'packageDescription')
    * updated function 'is.installed' to use 'system.file' instead of
      'installed.packages' for performance reasons
